#. ******************************************************************
#. * The following definitions are for status line prompts, messages, or
#. * warnings issued by Lynx during program execution.  You can modify
#. * them to make them more appropriate for your site.  We recommend that
#. * you extend these definitions to other languages using the gettext
#. * library.  There are also scattered uses of 'gettext()' throughout the
#. * Lynx source, covering all but those messages which (a) are used for
#. * debugging (CTRACE) or (b) are constants used in interaction with
#. * other programs.
#. *
#. * See ABOUT-NLS and po/readme for details and location of contributed
#. * translations.  When no translation is available, the English default is
#. * used.

#. NOTE TO TRANSLATORS:  If you provide a translation for "yes", lynx
#. * will take the first byte of the translation as a positive response
#. * to Yes/No questions.  If you provide a translation for "no", lynx
#. * will take the first byte of the translation as a negative response
#. * to Yes/No questions.  For both, lynx will also try to show the
#. * first byte in the prompt as a character, instead of (y) or (n),
#. * respectively.  This will not work right for multibyte charsets!
#. * Don't translate "yes" and "no" for CJK character sets (or translate
#. * them to "yes" and "no").  For a translation using UTF-8, don't
#. * translate if the translation would begin with anything but a 7-bit
#. * (US_ASCII) character.  That also means do not translate if the
#. * translation would begin with anything but a 7-bit character, if
#. * you use a single-byte character encoding (a charset like ISO-8859-n)
#. * but anticipate that the message catalog may be used re-encoded in
#. * UTF-8 form.
#. * For translations using other character sets, you may also wish to
#. * leave "yes" and "no" untranslated, if using (y) and (n) is the
#. * preferred behavior.
#. * Lynx will also accept y Y n N as responses unless there is a conflict
#. * with the first letter of the "yes" or "no" translation.

#. * translator can make an ordered list in parentheses with one
#. * capital letter for each as we assumed in HTConfirmDefault().
#. * The list has to be in the same order as in the original message,
#. * and the four capital letters chosen to not match those in the
